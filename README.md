step 1: let us take a file contains a string
->iam a computer science engineer.

step 2: Traverse through the file characters and find frequency of each letter.
        func  : void frequency() does this.
        we will be allocating array of size 127 to hash 127 ascii characters.
        and also find number of active elements(charaters taking part in file)
        
step 3: using the frequency array and no. of active elements.
        allocate the array of struct pointers...
        
step 4:
